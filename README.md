# terminals-hyde
Wallbash templates for terminal emulators that works on HyDE.


### Difference Between Wall-Ways and Wall-Dcol

- **Wall-Ways**: This file is always used regardless of the theme mode or wallbash mode.
- **Wall-Dcol**: This file attempts to find the theme template (if in theme mode) and falls back to using the dominant color of the wallpapers if no template is available.

## TODO
- Dedicated installation
  
## Contributions

- Enhance the template by adding more contrast to some elements.
- Avoid making breaking changes.
- Make readme comprehensive
- Feel free to open a PR for color corrections!
