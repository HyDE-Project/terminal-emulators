# terminals-hyde
Wallbash templates for terminal emulators that works on HyDE.


### Difference Between Wall-Ways and Wall-Dcol

- **Wall-Ways**: This directory is always used regardless of the theme mode or wallbash mode.
- **Wall-Dcol**: This directory attempts to find the theme template (if changing themes,in theme mode and reload_flag is on) and falls back to using the dominant color of the wallpapers if no template is available or in wallbash mode.

## TODO
- Dedicated installation
  
## Contributions

- Create a directory for a terminal emulator, inside that folder will be the dcol file and a README on how to use it. If external script is needed include it and be sure to explain how it works and how to use it.
- Enhance the template by adding more contrast to some elements.
- Avoid making breaking changes.
- Make readme comprehensive
- Feel free to open a PR for color corrections!
